# code-to-Start-a-jupyter-notebook-data-analysis-by-inputing-a-url-with-a-.cvs-file-in-it-
this is the initial code to Start a jupyter notebook data analysis. inputing just a url (with a .cvs file in it).

To analyze data you can use "Jupyter" (a program that shows info in your browser, kind of like a notebook) so you can add notes and code and see charts in the same page. 

but to start you have to input a bunch of borring code. Sure not all analysis need the same code, but most of them will use this. 
So 
1) input the url
2) run the code. and you{ll get an initial analysis done. like NAN (how much missing data you have), how many columns etc. etc.

just upload your .cvs file on https://gist.github.com/ and use that url
